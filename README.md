# Standalone Lesson for Newline NFC Course

In this standalone lesson for `The Newline Guide To NFCs With React Native`, I will first walk you through what we'll cover in the full course, after that we will incrementally build a NFC game app for iOS and Android.

NFC, as you might already know, is a wireless technology for short-range communication. 

It is already widely used in our daily life. Let's see some practical use-cases:
- Payment: Apple Pay and Samsung Pay both use NFC.
- Transportation and ticketing systems: for example, the Suica in Japan uses NFC.
- Access control and security systems: lots of applications in this domain choose NFC to be their communication protocol.
- Even in gaming: Nintendo Amiibo uses NFC to exchange data between Amiibo figures and the Nintendo Switch console.

Among these use-cases, we will focus on how to build mobile apps to interact with NFC tags.

Full Course Introduction
========================

What we will cover in this course
---------------------------------

First, I will provide an overview of NFC technology in the next lesson.

After that, we will build three apps throughout this course.

App 1 is a game app to count how much time a user needs to scan five NFC tags. You will learn how to properly set up an NFC project and how to trigger the scanning.

[App 1 Repo](https://github.com/whitedogg13/nfc-tag-counter-game-app)

App 2 is about NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF), which is the standard NFC data format supported by both iOS and Android. NDEF can be used for almost any NFC tag. We will build an NDEF reader-writer app to write specific links into NFC tags to trigger specific actions, for example, opening an URL, making a phone call, or sending a message. At the end of this module, we will also cover how to use deep linking with NFC tags.

App 3 dives into low-level NFC programming, which directly manipulates the NFC tagâ€™s internal memory and uses proprietary NFC commands. 
The app we'll build is called "NFC Pokemon," which is a digital identity management platform. It can seal a specific Pokemon, for example, a Pikachu, into an NFC tag. 

[App 3 Repo](https://github.com/whitedogg13/nfc-pokemon-app)

When building this app, we will also learn how to create digital signatures and use a proprietary password protection command to free our NFC Pokemon tags from attack.

What we will NOT cover
----------------------

This course is for NFC beginners, so we won't cover advanced topics here. 

NFC, as derived from radio-frequency identification (RFID), has lots of existing standards. We won't cover NFC operation modes other than reader mode, and we won't cover NFC tag types other than type 2 (we will talk more about these terminologies in the next lesson). 

We won't show you every API and parameter for the React Native NFC library either, since our goal is to make you comfortable writing an NFC app rather than being an API reference.

Prerequisites
-------------

To get the most out of this course, you will need: 
- A basic understanding of React Native
- A mobile phone with NFC feature because NFC features cannot be tested using a simulator
  - If you're an iOS user, all iPhones after iPhone 7 come with NFC support. (Please note that the iPad doesn't have NFC, only iPhone does.)
  - If you're an Android user, you should check your phone's settings. If your Android phone has NFC support, you should be able to find the NFC-related menu in your connectivity settings.
- iOS users will need to enroll in the "Apple Developer Program" in order to test our apps
- Finally, you need some NFC tags. We choose NXP NTAG 213 or 215 for this course. These are the most-used, cheapest NFC tags and can be purchased easily from Amazon. 

In the next lesson, I will give you a more detailed introduction to NFC technology. I'll see you there!

In this lesson, we will dive into writing code. We will show you how to:
- Check NFC availability
- Scan NFC tags
- Implement our game logic

First NFC App with React Native
======================================================

In the following section, I have extracted parts of our first `Tag Counter Game` app to give you a little tasts about programming NFC with React Native.

To build a NFC app with React Native, I recommend you to create a skeleton app via `react-native-cli`, and then install `react-native-nfc-manager`:

```
npx react-native init <MyNfcApp>
cd <MyNfcApp>
npm i react-native-nfc-manager
cd ios && pod install
```

> There's some extra set up required, please check [here](https://github.com/revtel/react-native-nfc-manager/blob/main/setup.md)

Detect NFC support 
------------------

The first thing for a NFC app is to detect whether the target mobile device has NFC support or not.

Let's create a `hasNfc` state. This state has an initial value to be `null`, which means we've not yet confirmed whether NFC is supported or not. Once we do, this state will be a boolean value `true` or `false`.

The next step is to actually check the NFC availability. By importing the `react-native-nfc-manager`, we can use the `isSupported` API, and it will resolve a boolean value to indicate whether the underlying device supports NFC or not.

Since the availability won't change during the whole app lifecycle, we can do this inside a `useEffect` hook, with no dependency. This basically simulates the `componentDidMount` behavior for React Class component.

And please be aware that the `isSupported` API (and most of the APIs for a `native module`) is an `async` function because our JavaScript code will need to cross the `bridge` and ask the corresponding native part for the result. 

```javascript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function checkNfc() {
      setHasNfc(await NfcManager.isSupported());
    }

    checkNfc();
  }, []);
```

If you're in simulator, the result will always be `not supported`, which is expected.

Let's run the code on a real iOS device. (All recent iPhones from iPhone 8 all support NFC)

Once we confirm that the device does support NFC, we can do the `native module` initialization by calling the `NfcManager.start` function.

```javascript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function checkNfc() {
      const supported = await NfcManager.isSupported();
      if (supported) {
        await NfcManager.start();
      }
      setHasNfc(supported);
    }

    checkNfc();
  }, []);
```

> Quick review: We just used the `isSupported` API to check the NFC availability, and if the device supports it, we then call `start` to initialize our NFC native module.

Scan for our first tag
----------------------

Now we're ready to scan NFC tags.

Again, import `NfcManager` and `NfcEvents` from `react-native-nfc-manager`.

Then, use `setEventListener` to listen to `NfcEvents.DiscoverTag` event. For now, we just log the message to the console. 

The actual tag scanning is through the `registerTagEvent` API. Once it discovers any NFC tags, the native side will emit `DiscoverTag` event with the tag data to the JavaScript side.

```javascript
  async function scanTag() {
    NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, (tag) => {
      console.warn('tag found', tag);
    });
    await NfcManager.registerTagEvent();
  };
```

Okay, let's test it on a real device. Please remember, the NFC antenna for an iPhone is on the top of the device, so the proper position to scan a tag is probably like this picture.

Now let's scan a tag.

Cool, something indeed happened. We can see the iOS NFC prompt pop up once we hit our start button, and the icon changes when the tag is scanned.

Let's see what's in our warning message here. It is an object that contains a `ndefMessage` property, which is an array. The object in this array contains properties such as `payload`, `type`, `tnf`,  and `id`:

```
{
  ndefMessage: [
    {
      payload: [
        4,
        114,
        101,
        97,
        99,
        116,
        110,
        97,
        116,
        105,
        118,
        101,
        46,
        100,
        101,
        118,
      ],
      type: [85],
      id: [],
      tnf: 1,
    },
  ],
};
```

Don't worry about them now; we will deep dive into these properties in our next app.

Next, let's move the event listener setup and clean up code into a `useEffect` hook.

```javascript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, (tag) => {
      console.warn(JSON.stringify(tag));
    });

    return () => {
      NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, null);
    };
  }, []);
```

Write a simple NFC game
-----------------------

Let's write a simple game to calculate how much time a player needs to scan five NFC tags. The shorter time means a better score. 

First, create a `start` state to track when a player hits the start button. Our `useEffect` hook should depend on this `start` state and re-run the hook logic when it is changed. Because in such a case, it basically means the user re-started the game.

Then, we use a variable called `count` inside the closure of our hook to track the remaining count left for a player to scan. 

Once the count becomes 0, the game is finished, and we should stop the NFC scanning by calling `NfcManager.unregisterTagEvent` and calculate the total elapsed time. 

```javascript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    let count = 5;

    NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, (tag) => {
      count--;

      if (count <= 0) {
        NfcManager.unregisterTagEvent().catch(() => 0);
        setDuration(new Date().getTime() - start.getTime());
      }
    });

    return () => {
      NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, null);
    };
  }, [start]);
```

And, of course, we will have to also render the duration into `React` elements.

Before testing it on a real device, we notice one thing. That is, during gameplay, the user cannot see any UI updates because the iOS default scan UI is on top of our `Game` component.

In order to provide users some messages while they play the game, we can use `NfcManager.setAlertMessageIOS` to update the iOS NFC scan prompt.

```javascript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    let count = 5;

    NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, (tag) => {
      count--;

      // show some updates to our player!
      NfcManager.setAlertMessageIOS(`${count}...`);

      if (count <= 0) {
        NfcManager.unregisterTagEvent().catch(() => 0);
        setDuration(new Date().getTime() - start.getTime());
      }
    });

    return () => {
      NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, null);
    };
  }, [start]);
```

The finished app code looks like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {View, Text, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity} from 'react-native';
import NfcManager from 'react-native-nfc-manager';
import Game from './Game';

function App(props) {
  const [hasNfc, setHasNfc] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function checkNfc() {
      const supported = await NfcManager.isSupported();
      if (supported) {
        await NfcManager.start();
      }
      setHasNfc(supported);
    }

    checkNfc();
  }, []);

  if (hasNfc === null) {
    return null;
  } else if (!hasNfc) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.wrapper}>
        <Text>You device doesn't support NFC</Text>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setModalVisible(true)}>
          <Text>Test</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return <Game />;
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  wrapper: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

Here's the `Game.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {TouchableOpacity, View, Text, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';
import NfcManager, {NfcEvents} from 'react-native-nfc-manager';

function Game(props) {
  const [start, setStart] = React.useState(null);
  const [duration, setDuration] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    let count = 5;
    NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, (tag) => {
      count--;
      NfcManager.setAlertMessageIOS(`${count}...`);
      if (count <= 0) {
        NfcManager.unregisterTagEvent().catch(() => 0);
        setDuration(new Date().getTime() - start.getTime());
      }
    });

    return () => {
      NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, null);
    };
  }, [start]);

  async function scanTag() {
    await NfcManager.registerTagEvent();
    setStart(new Date());
    setDuration(0);
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.wrapper}>
      <Text>NFC Game</Text>
      {duration > 0 && <Text>{duration} ms</Text>}
      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.btn} onPress={scanTag}>
        <Text>START</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  wrapper: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  btn: {
    margin: 15,
    padding: 15,
    borderRadius: 8,
    backgroundColor: '#ccc',
  },
});

export default Game;
```

Modifications for Android
=========================

Let's first run our previous work on a real Android device.

As you can see, I have pressed the `START` button several times, but it looks like there's nothing happened. 

What's wrong here? Actually, it's nothing wrong. It's because Android provides no built-in NFC scanning UI, so even though our app is ready to scan NFC tags, there's no visual cue for our users.

So, our next step in this lesson is to build a component to mimic the behavior for iOS NFC scanning UI.

Implement the AndroidPrompt component
-------------------------------------

Let's call it `AndroidPrompt`. This component will use React Native's built-in `Modal` component to present content above the enclosing view.

Normally in React, we use `props` passing as the primary interface between components. That's because of React's declarative nature. However, in our case, providing an imperative API set will be much easier.

The API we want to expose is something like React Native's built-in `Alert` module. For `Alert`, we simply call `Alert.alert`, and it will appear. From the caller's perspective, we don't need to preserve a state like `isAlertVisible` and pass it as props into `Alert`. We'd like to do something similar for our `AndroidPrompt` component here.  

In order to accomplish this, we will use `ref`:

```javascript
// omit imports

function AndroidPrompt(props, ref) { // notice the second argument
  const {hintText} = props;
  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => { 
    if (ref) {
      ref.current = { // allow clients code to call internal .setVisible()
        setVisible,
      };
    }
  }, [ref]);

  return (
    <Modal visible={visible} transparent={true}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <View style={[styles.backdrop, StyleSheet.absoluteFill]} />

        <View style={styles.prompt}>
          <Text style={styles.hint}>{hintText || 'Please Scan NFC'}</Text>

          <TouchableOpacity
            style={styles.btn}
            onPress={() => setVisible(false)}>
            <Text>CANCEL</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
      </View>
    </Modal>
  );
}

// omit the styling codes

export default React.forwardRef(AndroidPrompt); // wrap component with forwardRef
```

Animate the AndroidPrompt component
-------------------------------------

Now, it's the fun part. We'd like to add some animation into our `AndroidPrompt` component. 

The thought process for creating animation:

1. What state triggers the animation? 
2. How to update the `Animated.Value` object according to prior state change?
3. How to update the `style` using the changing `Animated.Value` object?

To handle the first and second questions, we create a new `useEffect` hook that depends on the `_visible` state and the `animValue` object.

This hook function will be triggered when `_visible` value changed, and if this value is true, which means we're about to show our component, we first set the `visible` state to true and use `Animated.timing` to gradually change the `animValue` from 0 to 1,

On the other hand, if the `_visible` is false, which means we're about to hide our component, we need to call `Animated.timing` first and then toggle the `visible` state to false in the completion handler, which is the callback passed into the `start` function. If we use the wrong order, the `Modal` will disappear instantly with no animation at all. That's why we need a second `_visible` state to signal the beginning of a transition, and the `visible` state is the one actually passed into our `Modal` component.

After that, we change all the existing `setVisible` into `_setVisible`. Since its actual usage is to trigger the `useEffect` hook, we should only call `setVisible` inside our effect hook.

The next step is to update the `style` using the `animValue`:
- for fade-in fade-out effect, we update the `backdrop` with the `opacity`. 
- for slide-up effect, we use `transateY` transform and let the `animValue` interpolate from 0 to 1.

By the way, always remember that only the `Animated` `View` can have animation-style in it. Otherwise, you'll have some trouble.

The final code looks like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {
  View,
  Text,
  Modal,
  StyleSheet,
  Dimensions,
  TouchableOpacity,
  Animated, // new import 
} from 'react-native';

function AndroidPrompt(props, ref) {
  const [_visible, _setVisible] = React.useState(false);
  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(false);
  const [hintText, setHintText] = React.useState('');
  const animValue = React.useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (ref) {
      ref.current = {
        setVisible: _setVisible, // client codes can only access _visible
        setHintText,
      };
    }
  }, [ref]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (_visible) {
      setVisible(true); // set to visible first, then do transition
      Animated.timing(animValue, {
        duration: 300,
        toValue: 1,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }).start();
    } else {
      Animated.timing(animValue, { // do transition first, then set to invisible
        duration: 300,
        toValue: 0,
        useNativeDriver: true,
      }).start(() => {
        setVisible(false);
        setHintText('');
      });
    }
  }, [_visible, animValue]); // detect _visible change, use it to drive our animation

  const backdropAnimStyle = {
    opacity: animValue,
  };

  const promptAnimStyle = {
    transform: [
      {
        translateY: animValue.interpolate({ // for the slide-up effect
          inputRange: [0, 1],
          outputRange: [500, 0],
        }),
      },
    ],
  };

  return (
    <Modal visible={visible} transparent={true}>
      <View style={styles.content}>
        <Animated.View
          style={[styles.backdrop, StyleSheet.absoluteFill, backdropAnimStyle]}
        />

        <Animated.View style={[styles.prompt, promptAnimStyle]}>
          <Text style={styles.hint}>{hintText || 'Hello NFC'}</Text>

          <TouchableOpacity
            style={styles.btn}
            onPress={() => {
              _setVisible(false);
            }}>
            <Text>CANCEL</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </Animated.View>
      </View>
    </Modal>
  );
}

// omit the styling codes

export default React.forwardRef(AndroidPrompt);
```

Use our AndroidPrompt component in the game
-------------------------------------------

The final step is to use our `AndroidPrompt` component in our game.

The logic is pretty straightforward
- when the `NfcManager.registerTagEvent` is called, we should set our `AndroidPrompt` to be visible, by calling `androidPromptRef.current.setVisible(true)`.
- When the user is playing, we can update the hint text according to the platform. If it's `Android`, we will call our custom `setHintText` function from ref; if it's `iOS`, we simply call `setAlertMessageIOS`.
- Once the game is finished, we should set our `AndroidPrompt` to be invisible. 

Okay, it seems like we're ready to test it. Before testing, you will need to check the position of the NFC antenna for your Android device because they might be in different places according to different Android manufacturers. 

The updated `Game` component looks like this (notice the `AndroidPrompt` related code):

```javascript
// omit other imports
import AndroidPrompt from './AndroidPrompt';

function Game(props) {
  const [start, setStart] = React.useState(null);
  const [duration, setDuration] = React.useState(0);
  const androidPromptRef = React.useRef(); // call React.useRef() to obtain a ref object

  React.useEffect(() => {
    let count = 5;
    NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, (tag) => {
      count--;

      if (Platform.OS === 'android') { // set hint text for AndroidPrompt
        androidPromptRef.current.setHintText(`${count}...`);
      } else {
        NfcManager.setAlertMessageIOS(`${count}...`);
      }

      if (count <= 0) {
        NfcManager.unregisterTagEvent().catch(() => 0);
        setDuration(new Date().getTime() - start.getTime());

        if (Platform.OS === 'android') { // hide AndroidPrompt
          androidPromptRef.current.setVisible(false);
        }
      }
    });

    return () => {
      NfcManager.setEventListener(NfcEvents.DiscoverTag, null);
    };
  }, [start]);

  async function scanTag() {
    await NfcManager.registerTagEvent();
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') { // show AndroidPrompt
      androidPromptRef.current.setVisible(true);
    }
    setStart(new Date());
    setDuration(0);
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.wrapper}>
      <Text style={styles.label}>NFC Game</Text>

      <View style={styles.content}>
        {(duration > 0 && (
          <Text style={styles.minLabel}>{duration} ms</Text>
        )) || <Text style={styles.minLabel}>Let's go!</Text>}
      </View>

      <TouchableOpacity onPress={scanTag}>
        <View style={styles.btn}>
          <Text style={styles.playLabel}>PLAY!</Text>
        </View>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <AndroidPrompt
        ref={androidPromptRef} 
      />
    </View>
  );
}

// omit the styles
```

Pass the onCancelPress callback
-------------------------------

Though the app seems to be working correctly, there's actually a potential bug.

That is, once the user presses the `CANCEL` button in our `AndroidPrompt`, we won't actually stop the NFC from scanning because our `Game` component is not aware of it.

To fix this issue, we first add the `onCancelPress` into our `AndroidPrompt` component and call it when the `CANCEL` button is pressed.

And then, go back to our `Game` component, pass the `onCancelPress` prop into `AndroidPrompt` component, and call `unregisterTagEvent` inside it.

Check if NFC is enabled
-----------------------

Besides the system-scanning UI, there's another difference between Android and iOS. That is, NFC can be disabled in Android. 

So, for the Android app, before the game starts, we will need to confirm that the NFC is enabled. Let's do it right now.

First, create an `enabled` state, and in our `checkNfc` function, we call `NfcManager.isEnabled()`. This API will resolve to a boolean value to indicate whether the NFC is enabled or not.

Let's use this state in our render logic: if the NFC is `supported` but not `enabled`, we show a hint to our users and provide a button for the user to jump to the NFC system setting screen by calling `NfcManager.goToNfcSetting()`. (Please be aware, this API only works on Android.)

You might wonder, what about iOS? Actually, our `NfcManager.isEnabled()` will always return true since there's no NFC switch for iOS. So, we can confirm that the runtime execution flow will never reach here.

Finally, we also provide a button to let the user re-check the NFC enable state.

It's about time to test our modifications.

We first disable NFC and then launch our app. As you can see, our UI provides a hint about our NFC state. Hit "**GO TO SETTINGS**" to enable NFC. Then back to our app again, re-check the state, and now the user can enter the game.

Cool! Now we have a simple but fully functional NFC tag counter game app for both Android and iOS!

Here's the modified code for `App.js`:

```javascript
// omit imports

function App(props) {
  const [hasNfc, setHasNfc] = React.useState(null);
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = React.useState(null); // new state

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function checkNfc() {
      const supported = await NfcManager.isSupported();
      if (supported) {
        await NfcManager.start();
        setEnabled(await NfcManager.isEnabled()); // only for Android, always true for iOS
      }
      setHasNfc(supported);
    }

    checkNfc();
  }, []);

  if (hasNfc === null) {
    return null;
  } else if (!hasNfc) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.wrapper}>
        <Text>You device doesn't support NFC</Text>
      </View>
    );
  } else if (!enabled) { // only for Android
    return (
      <View style={styles.wrapper}>
        <Text>Your NFC is not enabled!</Text>

        <TouchableOpacity
          onPress={() => {
            NfcManager.goToNfcSetting();
          }}>
          <Text>GO TO NFC SETTINGS</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>

        <TouchableOpacity
          onPress={async () => {
            setEnabled(await NfcManager.isEnabled());
          }}>
          <Text>CHECK AGAIN</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return <Game />;
}
// omit styles
```
